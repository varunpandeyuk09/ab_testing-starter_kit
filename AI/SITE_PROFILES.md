# SITE_PROFILES.md — Confirmed DOM Facts per Client

Purpose: one place to store hard-won DOM knowledge so a new session does NOT have to
re-autopsy a site. Check this file BEFORE inspecting the live page (AGENTS.md STEP 1).

## How to add a profile

- Add a `## CLIENT` section after you have VERIFIED the facts against the live site.
- Only record stable selectors, AJAX endpoints, theme gotchas, and working techniques.
- Note the test that proved each fact (so a future session can read its code).
- Delete/update entries when a client's theme changes break them.

## AWG

- **Site:** https://www.awg-mode.de — German, Shopware 6.
- **Verified in:** `../ABTESTSWITHAI/AWG/AB042 Sitewide Navigation structure mobile` (variation1/variation.js uses every selector below).

### Mobile navigation (offcanvas menu)
- The mobile menu is a Shopware offcanvas built from the hidden source block
  `.js-navigation-offcanvas-initial-content` (class `d-none ... is-root`).
- Inside it, `.offcanvas-body` holds two siblings:
  1. `#mainMenuContainer.navigation-offcanvas-main-menu` — the 4 top-level tabs.
     Tab markup (NOTE: no `href` attribute, so tabs are not plain links):
     ```html
     <a class="nav-item nav-link navigation-offcanvas-link js-navigation-offcanvas-link
                main-navigation-link val-main-navigation-link"
        data-href="/widgets/menu/offcanvas?navigationId=<category-uuid>"
        data-active-id="<category-uuid>"
        data-category-name="Damen|Herren|Kinder|Wohnen">Label</a>
     ```
  2. `.navigation-offcanvas-container` — EMPTY on page load; submenus are AJAX-loaded into it.

### Submenu AJAX endpoint
- `GET /widgets/menu/offcanvas?navigationId=<category-uuid>` returns
  `.navigation-offcanvas-content` containing:
  - `.navigation-offcanvas-previous` → `a.navigation-offcanvas-btn` "Zur Übersicht" —
    its **href is the active category page URL** (e.g. `https://www.awg-mode.de/wohnen`).
    This is THE reliable active-tab signal.
  - `ul.navigation-offcanvas-list` → `.navigation-offcanvas-list-item` →
    `a.navigation-offcanvas-link` subcategory links (first path segment = top-level tab too).
- Every category URL starts with one of `damen | herren | kinder | wohnen`.

### Theme gotchas
- Tab clicks are handled by a custom theme plugin that does NOT live in the base
  `awg_storefront.js` bundle (it is in a lazy-loaded webpack chunk whose URL is not
  easily resolvable — don't waste time reading the plugin source).
- The theme suppresses/overrides tab click events and sets `.active`
  (`.navigation-offcanvas .navigation-offcanvas-main-menu .nav-link.active` →
  bold `#2A3031` + `:after` underline) asynchronously — **click listeners and
  `.active`-class reads are NOT reliable**.
- Use pattern **P25**: MutationObserver on `.navigation-offcanvas-container` / body,
  watch for `.navigation-offcanvas-previous` being added, derive the tab from the
  Zur-Übersicht link href's first path segment.

### Other notes
- `rg` is not installed on this machine's PowerShell — use `Select-String` or
  `[regex]::Match` on the raw file content instead.
- Quick submenu DOM check without a browser:
  `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://www.awg-mode.de/widgets/menu/offcanvas?navigationId=<uuid>"`.
